# Fixing the Habbo Camera Problem

This guide explains how to handle and validate room images in Habbo, ensuring they keep a proper isometric view.

## 1. Server-Side Processing

1. **Data Received from Client:**
   - Full room image.
   - `room_id` (which room is captured).
   - `(x, y)` coordinates for cropping.
   - `zoom` level.

2. **Initial Validation:**
   - **Room Shape Mask**: Use `room_id` to apply a mask that checks if the image matches the roomâ€™s shape.

## 2. Validation Steps

1. **Room Shape Masking**
   - Confirms the image boundaries align with the expected layout.

2. **Score System for Isometry**
   - **Habbo Faces Check**: Confirms Habbo characters are correctly oriented.
   - **Edge Detection**: Ensures edges follow the isometric perspective.

## 3. Final Image Processing

1. **Cropping**  
   - Cut the image using `(x, y)` and `zoom`.
2. **Filtering**  
   - Apply any post-processing filters (e.g., sharpening or color-correction).

## 4. Optimization Techniques

1. **Cached Room Shapes**  
   - Precompute shapes for common rooms to speed up masking.
2. **Parallelized Edge Detection**  
   - Break the image into tiles and run edge checks simultaneously.
3. **Incremental Validation**  
   - Reuse previous computations for small zoom changes.
4. **Selective Filtering**  
   - Only filter areas that changed due to cropping or zoom adjustments.

Things to consider: This is an example of the algorithm but in the real world, the image is taken from shockwave. And there is no game scale applied.


Optiomizations: The sobel facemask can be already calculated via an image.
We can use another image channel to set which pixels might change on other expressions doing the facecheck on one pass.
